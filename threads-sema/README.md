# Fork/Join

Simple example of the fork/join (i.e., waiting for a child) problem
using semaphores, found in `join.c`.

Run `make` to build the code; run `join` to test it. Fun!





# Dining Philosophers

The dining philosophers example from the text is found herein, in a few
different forms:
- `dining_philosophers.c`: code with deadlock
- `dining_philosophers_print.c`: code with deadlock, and some useful printing
- `dining_philosophers_no_deadlock.c`: code without deadlock
- `dining_philosophers_no_deadlock_print.c`: code without deadlock, and some useful printing

Run `make` to build all of them with the highly primitive `Makefile`.
